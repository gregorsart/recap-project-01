# First Recap Project

## Some advice

- always pull at the very beginning, before working
- Do not work directly on the main branch, instead make a feature branch
- Make PR Request so that the rest of the team knows what you did

## Bugs of the current version

All bugs are conected to local storage and I guess also dynamic page generation and page reload as well as "state".

- You can only delete one card at a time at the moment
- You can only bookmark one card at a time at the moment
- If you add three items and then bookmark all of them (let's say "a", "b" and "c"), then you go to the bookmark page and un-bookmark "b", then go back to the index page, where all cards shoud be listed, only "b" is left.
